# ECLT5830_webprogram
A simple individual web page based on nodejs, mongodb and netlify. Node modules are not included due to size so it can not directly run. You can see what will be shown on https://1155180259-asg4.netlify.app 

The link web page is a simple list of pictures, link to its descriptions, a home button and a messageboard. The message history will externally exist unless manully deleted from mongodb.

Pay attention, the mongodb url in getmsg.js is removed for security.
